This is a blog from Fanghao Tian, a curcois open-minded human being trying to explore how nature and world work, pursuing a PhD dgree from Ku Leuven & Energyville based in Belgium. It is mainly for sharing practical engineering knowledges, and possibly some random thoughts about life. The topics are mostly about AI, optimization, and anything else that is interesting in my life.
