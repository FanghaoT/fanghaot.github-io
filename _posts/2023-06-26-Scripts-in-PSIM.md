# PSIM

PSIM (PowerSIM) is a simulation software tool used for designing, simulating, and analyzing power electronics and motor drive systems. It is widely used by engineers and researchers in the fields of power electronics.

## Script Function

The script function in PSIM refers to the capability of writing and executing scripts to automate tasks, customize simulations, and perform advanced operations beyond the standard graphical user interface (GUI) interactions. The scripting functionality in PSIM allows users to extend the capabilities of the software by writing scripts in the PSIM script language.

## Automation of Buck Converter Simulation

Here is a demonstration of using the script function in automating a buck converter simulation. The compelete tutorial can be found in [help-->Tutorials-->How to use scripts function](#). However, This page shows a simple example of buck converter secenario for the users getting started easily.

## Step 1
Step1: run one simulation by script
Create a script file by easily clicking [Script] in the menu, and choose [Script-Tool]. For comanding a simple simulation, all you need to do is to define parameters and then use [Simulate] function.
