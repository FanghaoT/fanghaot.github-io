PSIM (PowerSIM) is a simulation software tool used for designing, simulating, and analyzing power electronics and motor drive systems. It is widely used by engineers and researchers in the fields of power electronics.
The script function in PSIM refers to the capability of writing and executing scripts to automate tasks, customize simulations, and perform advanced operations beyond the standard graphical user interface (GUI) interactions. The scripting functionality in PSIM allows users to extend the capabilities of the software by writing scripts in the PSIM script language.
Here is a demonstration of using Scripts function in automating a buck converter simulation. The tutorial can be found in help--Tutorials--How to use scripts function.
